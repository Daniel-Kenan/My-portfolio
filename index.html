 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>Hello there :-) . Thank you for visiting my website it is nice to have you . I am an intermidiate Software Developer . 
    Coding changed my life in a way that I can't fully express . I was depressed for years with a void that affected mentally and academically 
    and a thorough self introspection made me lead to me realise that my passion for computers. Then i remembered  that whilst I was still in High School
    I would assist my teachers and schoolmates in technical issues with their gadgets from cellphones to the smart computers that teachers 
    were using to present their work with . During the end of High Schools years I was selected to go on a trip to tech conference where I interaccted with 
    different tech companies and that's the moment that changed my life.
    as I recalled my experience in highschool I surfed through playstore and found a app called sololearn and I was introduced to the world of 
    possibilities.
