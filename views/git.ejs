    <h3>Git</h3>
     git is a version control system tracking file changes and revisions over time
     and is fantastic when working with huge projects and multiple developers. Tracking these revisions over time is called
      Version Control.
      <h3>The benefits of using Version Control System</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Better management of source code over time.</li>
          <li>Better collabborations of a software deveopment team.</li>
          <li>Speeds up development of a software.</li>
          <li>prevents changes of source code that are incompatible with changes made at 
              the same time by another developer.
          </li>
      </ol>
<h3>How does Git work?</h3>
<p>Git tracks changes by taking snapshots of files and records the changes as stream of snapshots</p>

  <pre>git status   <span class="comment">displays modified files and files that are not commited</span></pre>
  <pre>git add #filename  <span class="comment"></span> </pre>
  <pre>git add .</pre>
  <pre>git commit -M "initial commit"  <span class="comment"> commit message</span></pre>
